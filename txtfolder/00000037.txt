THE    CHINESE    CHARACTER              53
Chinese literature from becoming a mere collection of eulogies on the imperial virtues and a rehash of moral exhortations. All good Chinese literature, all Chinese literature that is worth while, that is readable, and that pleases the human mind and
soothes the human heart is essentially imbued with this Taoistic spirit. Taoism and Confucianism are the negative and positive poles of Chinese thought which make life possible in China.

The only part of Christian teachings which will be truly accepted by the Chinese people is Christ*s injunction to be harmless as doves" but "wise as serpents." For these two virtues, dove-like gentle-
