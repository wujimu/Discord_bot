discovering that his forefathers In the primeval forests had the right blood in them, and that sets his mind at peace and relieves him of all anxiety to study things Chinese* But he is also uncomfortable every time his business takes him through Chinese streets where the heathen eyes all stare at him. He takes,his handkerchief and vociferously blows his nose with it and bravely endures it, all "the while in a blue funk. He broadly surveys the wave of blue-dressed humanity.
