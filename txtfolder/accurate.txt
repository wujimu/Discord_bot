第一章 
 
道可道 非常道 名可名 非常名 無名天地之始 有名萬物之母 故常無欲 以觀其妙 常有欲 以觀其徼 此兩者 同出而異名 同謂之玄 玄之又玄 眾妙之門 
 
Chapter 1 
 
The Tao that can be spoken is not the eternal Tao The name that can be named is not the eternal name The nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth The named is the mother of myriad things Thus, constantly without desire, one observes its essence Constantly with desire, one observes its manifestations These two emerge together but differ in name The unity is said to be the mystery Mystery of mysteries, the door to all wonders 
 
第二章 
 
天下皆知美之為美 斯惡已 皆知善之為善 斯不善已 故有無相生 難易相成 長短相形 高下相傾 音聲相和 前後相隨 是以聖人 處無為之事 行不言之教 萬物作焉而不辭 生而不有 為而不恃 功成而弗居 夫唯弗居 是以不去 
 
Chapter 2 
 
When the world knows beauty as beauty, ugliness arises When it knows good as good, evil arises Thus being and non-being produce each other Difficult and easy bring about each other Long and short reveal each other High and low support each other Music and voice harmonize each other Front and back follow each other Therefore the sages: Manage the work of detached actions Conduct the teaching of no words They work with myriad things but do not control They create but do not possess They act but do not presume They succeed but do not dwell on success It is because they do not dwell on success That it never goes away 
 
第三章 
 
不尚賢 使民不爭 不貴難得之貨 使民不為盜 不見可欲 使民心不亂 是以聖人之治 虛其心 實其腹 弱其志 強其骨 常使民無知無欲 使夫智者不敢為也 為無為 則無不治 
 
Chapter 3 
 
Do not glorify the achievers So the people will not squabble Do not treasure goods that are hard to obtain So the people will not become thieves Do not show the desired things So their hearts will not be confused Thus the governance of the sage: Empties their hearts Fills their bellies Weakens their ambitions Strengthens their bones Let the people have no cunning and no greed So those who scheme will not dare to meddle Act without contrivance And nothing will be beyond control 
 
第四章 
 
道沖而用之或不盈 淵兮似萬物之宗 挫其銳 解其紛 和其光 同其塵 湛兮似或存 吾不知誰之子 象帝之先 
 
Chapter 4 
 
The Tao is empty; when utilized, it is not filled up So deep! It seems to be the source of all things It blunts the sharpness Unravels the knots Dims the glare Mixes the dusts So indistinct! It seems to exist I do not know whose offspring it is Its image is the predecessor of the Emperor 
 
第五章 
 
天地不仁 以萬物為芻狗 聖人不仁 以百姓為芻狗 天地之間 其猶橐籥乎 虛而不屈 動而愈出 多言數窮 不如守中 
 
Chapter 5 
 
Heaven and Earth are impartial They regard myriad things as straw dogs The sages are impartial They regard people as straw dogs The space between Heaven and Earth Is it not like a bellows? Empty, and yet never exhausted It moves, and produces more Too many words hasten failure Cannot compare to keeping to the void 
 
第六章 
 
谷神不死 是謂玄牝 玄牝之門 是謂天地根 綿綿若存 用之不勤 
 
Chapter 6 
 
The valley spirit, undying Is called the Mystic Female The gate of the Mystic Female Is called the root of Heaven and Earth It flows continuously, barely perceptible Utilize it; it is never exhausted 
 
第七章 
 
天長地久 天地所以能長且久者 以其不自生 故能長生 是以聖人 後其身而身先 外其身而身存 非以其無私邪 故能成其私 
 
Chapter 7 
 
Heaven and Earth are everlasting The reason Heaven and Earth can last forever Is that they do not exist for themselves Thus they can last forever Therefore the sages: Place themselves last but end up in front Are outside of themselves and yet survive Is it not due to their selflessness? That is how they can achieve their own goals 
 
第八章 
 
上善若水 水善利萬物而不爭 處眾人之所惡 故幾於道 居善地 心善淵 與善仁 言善信 正善治 事善能 動善時 夫唯不爭 故無尤 
 
Chapter 8 
 
The highest goodness resembles water Water greatly benefits myriad things without contention It stays in places that people dislike Therefore it is similar to the Tao Dwelling with the right location Feeling with great depth Giving with great kindness Speaking with great integrity Governing with great administration Handling with great capability Moving with great timing Because it does not contend It is therefore beyond reproach 
 
第九章 
 
持而盈之 不如其已 揣而銳之 不可長保 金玉滿堂 莫之能守 富貴而驕 自遺其咎 功遂 身退 天之道 
 
Chapter 9 
 
Holding a cup and overfilling it Cannot be as good as stopping short Pounding a blade and sharpening it Cannot be kept for long Gold and jade fill up the room No one is able to protect them Wealth and position bring arrogance And leave disasters upon oneself When achievement is completed, fame is attained Withdraw oneself This is the Tao of Heaven 
 
第十章 
 
載營魄抱一 能無離乎 專氣致柔 能嬰兒乎 滌除玄覽 能無疵乎 愛民治國 能無為乎 天門開闔 能為雌乎 明白四達 能無知乎 生之畜之 生而不有 為而不恃 長而不宰 是謂玄德 
 
Chapter 10 
 
In holding the soul and embracing oneness Can one be steadfast, without straying? In concentrating the energy and reaching relaxation Can one be like an infant? In cleaning away the worldly view Can one be without imperfections? In loving the people and ruling the nation Can one be without manipulation? In the heavenly gate's opening and closing Can one hold to the feminine principle? In understanding clearly all directions Can one be without intellectuality? Bearing it, rearing it Bearing without possession Achieving without arrogance Raising without domination This is called the Mystic Virtue 
 
第十一章 
 
三十幅 共一轂 當其無 有車之用 埏埴以為器 當其無 有器之用 鑿戶牖以為室 當其無 有室之用 故有之以為利 無之以為用 
 
Chapter 11 
 
Thirty spokes join in one hub In its emptiness, there is the function of a vehicle Mix clay to create a container In its emptiness, there is the function of a container Cut open doors and windows to create a room In its emptiness, there is the function of a room Therefore, that which exists is used to create benefit That which is empty is used to create functionality 
 
第十二章 
 
五色令人目盲 五音令人耳聾 五味令人口爽 馳騁畋獵令人心發狂 難得之貨令人行妨 是以聖人為腹不為目 故去彼取此 
 
Chapter 12 
 
The five colors make one blind in the eyes The five sounds make one deaf in the ears The five flavors make one tasteless in the mouth Racing and hunting make one wild in the heart Goods that are difficult to acquire make one cause damage Therefore the sages care for the stomach and not the eyes That is why they discard the other and take this 
 
第十三章 
 
寵辱若驚 貴大患若身 何謂寵辱若驚 寵為上 辱為下 得之若驚 失之若驚 是謂寵辱若驚 何謂貴大患若身 吾所以有大患者 為吾有身 及吾無身 吾有何患 故貴以身為天下 若可寄天下 愛以身為天下 若可託天下 
 
Chapter 13 
 
Favor and disgrace make one fearful The greatest misfortune is the self What does "favor and disgrace make one fearful" mean? Favor is high; disgrace is low Having it makes one fearful Losing it makes one fearful This is "favor and disgrace make one fearful" What does "the greatest misfortune is the self" mean? The reason I have great misfortune Is that I have the self If I have no self What misfortune do I have? So one who values the self as the world Can be given the world One who loves the self as the world Can be entrusted with the world 
 
第十四章 
 
視之不見 名曰夷 聽之不聞 名曰希 摶之不得 名曰微 此三者不可致詰 故混而為一 其上不皦 其下不昧 繩繩不可名 復歸於無物 是謂無狀之狀 無象之象 是謂惚恍 迎之不見其首 隨之不見其後 執古之道 以御今之有 能知古始 是謂道紀 
 
Chapter 14 
 
Look at it, it cannot be seen It is called colorless Listen to it, it cannot be heard It is called noiseless Reach for it, it cannot be held It is called formless These three cannot be completely unraveled So they are combined into one Above it, not bright Below it, not dark Continuing endlessly, cannot be named It returns back into nothingness Thus it is called the form of the formless The image of the imageless This is called enigmatic Confront it, its front cannot be seen Follow it, its back cannot be seen Wield the Tao of the ancients To manage the existence of today One can know the ancient beginning It is called the Tao Axiom 
 
第十五章 
 
古之善為士者 微妙玄通 深不可識 夫唯不可識 故強為之容 豫兮若冬涉川 猶兮若畏四鄰 儼兮其若容 渙兮若冰之將釋 敦兮其若樸 曠兮其若谷 混兮其若濁 孰能濁以止 靜之徐清 孰能安以久 動之徐生 保此道者不欲盈 夫唯不盈 故能蔽不新成 
 
Chapter 15 
 
The Tao masters of antiquity Subtle wonders through mystery Depths that cannot be discerned Because one cannot discern them Therefore one is forced to describe the appearance Hesitant, like crossing a wintry river Cautious, like fearing four neighbors Solemn, like a guest Loose, like ice about to melt Genuine, like plain wood Open, like a valley Opaque, like muddy water Who can be muddled yet desist In stillness gradually become clear? Who can be serene yet persist In motion gradually come alive? One who holds this Tao does not wish to be overfilled Because one is not overfilled Therefore one can preserve and not create anew 
 
第十六章 
 
致虛極 守靜篤 萬物並作 吾以觀復 夫物芸芸 各復歸其根 歸根曰靜 是謂復命 復命曰常 知常曰明 不知常 妄作凶 知常容 容乃公 公乃王 王乃天 天乃道 道乃久 沒身不殆 
 
Chapter 16 
 
Attain the ultimate emptiness Hold on to the truest tranquility The myriad things are all active I therefore watch their return Everything flourishes; each returns to its root Returning to the root is called tranquility Tranquility is called returning to one's nature Returning to one's nature is called constancy Knowing constancy is called clarity Not knowing constancy, one recklessly causes trouble Knowing constancy is acceptance Acceptance is impartiality Impartiality is sovereign Sovereign is Heaven Heaven is Tao Tao is eternal The self is no more, without danger 
 
第十七章 
 
太上 不知有之 其次 親而譽之 其次 畏之 其次 侮之 信不足焉 有不信焉 悠兮其貴言 功成事遂 百姓皆謂 我自然 
 
Chapter 17 
 
The highest rulers, people do not know they have them The next level, people love them and praise them The next level, people fear them The next level, people despise them If the rulers' trust is insufficient Have no trust in them Proceeding calmly, valuing their words Task accomplished, matter settled The people all say, "We did it naturally" 
 
第十八章 
 
大道廢 有仁義 智慧出 有大偽 六親不和 有孝慈 國家昏亂 有忠臣 
 
Chapter 18 
 
The great Tao fades away There is benevolence and justice Intelligence comes forth There is great deception The six relations are not harmonious There is filial piety and kind affection The country is in confused chaos There are loyal ministers 
第十九章 
 
絕聖棄智 民利百倍 絕仁棄義 民復孝慈 絕巧棄利 盜賊無有 此三者 以為文不足 故令有所屬 見素抱樸 少私寡欲 
 
Chapter 19 
 
End sagacity; abandon knowledge The people benefit a hundred times End benevolence; abandon righteousness The people return to piety and charity End cunning; discard profit Bandits and thieves no longer exist These three things are superficial and insufficient Thus this teaching has its place: Show plainness; hold simplicity Reduce selfishness; decrease desires 
 
第二十章 
 
絕學無憂 唯之與阿 相去幾何 善之與惡 相去若何 人之所畏 不可不畏 荒兮 其未央哉 眾人熙熙 如享太牢 如春登臺 我獨泊兮其未兆 如嬰兒之未孩 乘乘兮若無所歸 眾人皆有餘 而我獨若遺 我愚人之心也哉 沌沌兮俗人昭昭 我獨昏昏 俗人察察 我獨悶悶 澹兮其若海 飂兮若無所止 眾人皆有以 而我獨頑且鄙 我獨異於人 而貴食母 
 
Chapter 20 
 
Cease learning, no more worries Respectful response and scornful response How much is the difference? Goodness and evil How much do they differ? What the people fear, I cannot be unafraid So desolate! How limitless it is! The people are excited As if enjoying a great feast As if climbing up to the terrace in spring I alone am quiet and uninvolved Like an infant not yet smiling So weary, like having no place to return The people all have surplus While I alone seem lacking I have the heart of a fool indeed – so ignorant! Ordinary people are bright I alone am muddled Ordinary people are scrutinizing I alone am obtuse Such tranquility, like the ocean Such high wind, as if without limits The people all have goals And I alone am stubborn and lowly I alone am different from them And value the nourishing mother 
 
第二十一章 
 
孔德之容 惟道是從 道之為物 惟恍惟惚 惚兮恍兮 其中有象 恍兮惚兮 其中有物 窈兮冥兮 其中有精 其精甚真 其中有信 自古及今 其名不去 以閱眾甫 吾何以知眾甫之狀哉 以此 
 
Chapter 21 
 
The appearance of great virtue Follows only the Tao The Tao, as a thing Seems indistinct, seems unclear So unclear, so indistinct Within it there is image So indistinct, so unclear Within it there is substance So deep, so profound Within it there is essence Its essence is supremely real Within it there is faith From ancient times to the present Its name never departs To observe the source of all things How do I know the nature of the source? With this 
 
第二十二章 
 
曲則全 枉則直 窪則盈 敝則新 少則得 多則惑 是以聖人抱一 為天下式 不自見故明 不自是故彰 不自伐故有功 不自矜故長 夫唯不爭 故天下莫能與之爭 古之所謂曲則全者 豈虛言哉 誠全而歸之 
 
Chapter 22 
 
Yield and remain whole Bend and remain straight Be low and become filled Be worn out and become renewed Have little and receive Have much and be confused Therefore the sages hold to the one as an example for the world Without flaunting themselves – and so are seen clearly Without presuming themselves – and so are distinguished Without praising themselves – and so have merit Without boasting about themselves – and so are lasting Because they do not contend the world cannot contend with them What the ancients called "the one who yields and remains whole" Were they speaking empty words? Sincerity becoming whole, and returning to oneself 
 
第二十三章 
 
希言自然 故飄風不終朝 驟雨不終日 孰為此者 天地 天地尚不能久 而況於人乎 故從事於道者 道者同於道 德者同於德 失者同於失 同於道者 道亦樂得之 同於德者 德亦樂得之 同於失者 失於樂得之 信不足焉有不信焉 
 
Chapter 23 
 
Sparse speech is natural Thus strong wind does not last all morning Sudden rain does not last all day What makes this so? Heaven and Earth Even Heaven and Earth cannot make it last How can humans? Thus for those who follow the Tao: Those of the Tao are with the Tao Those of virtue are with virtue Those of loss are with loss Those who are with the Tao the Tao is also pleased to have them Those who are with virtue virtue is also pleased to have them Those who are with loss loss is also please to have them Those who do not trust sufficiently, others have no trust in them 
第二十四章 
 
企者不立 跨者不行 自見者不明 自是者不彰 自伐者無功 自矜者不長 其在道也 曰餘食贅形 物或惡之 故有道者不處 
 
Chapter 24 
 
Those who are on tiptoes cannot stand Those who straddle cannot walk Those who flaunt themselves are not clear Those who presume themselves are not distinguished Those who praise themselves have no merit Those who boast about themselves do not last Those with the Tao call such things leftover food or tumors They despise them Thus, those who possesses the Tao do not engage in them 
 
第二十五章 
 
有物混成 先天地生 寂兮寥兮 獨立不改 周行而不殆 可以為天下母 吾不知其名 字之曰道 強為之名曰大 大曰逝 逝曰遠 遠曰反 故道大 天大 地大 王亦大 域中有四大 而王居其一焉 人法地 地法天 天法道 道法自然 
 
Chapter 25 
 
There is something formlessly created Born before Heaven and Earth So silent! So ethereal! Independent and changeless Circulating and ceaseless It can be regarded as the mother of the world I do not know its name To identify it, I call it "Tao" Forced to describe it, I call it great Great means passing Passing means receding Receding means returning Therefore the Tao is great Heaven is great Earth is great The sovereign is also great There are four greats in the universe And the sovereign occupies one of them Humans follow the laws of Earth Earth follows the laws of Heaven Heaven follows the laws of Tao Tao follows the laws of nature 
 
第二十六章 
 
重為輕根 靜為躁君 是以聖人終日行 不離輜重 雖有榮觀 燕處超然 奈何萬乘之主 而以身輕天下 輕則失根 躁則失君 
 
Chapter 26 
 
Heaviness is the root of lightness Quietness is the master of restlessness Therefore the sages travel an entire day Without leaving the heavy supplies Even though there are luxurious sights They are composed and transcend beyond How can the lords of ten thousand chariots Apply themselves lightly to the world? To be light is to lose one's root To be restless is to lose one's mastery 
 
第二十七章 
 
善行無轍跡 善言無瑕謫 善數不用籌策 善閉無關楗而不可開 善結無繩約而不可解 是以聖人 常善救人 故無棄人 常善救物 故無棄物 是謂襲明 故善人者 不善人之師 不善人者 善人之資 不貴其師 不愛其資 雖智大迷 是謂要妙 
 
Chapter 27 
 
Good traveling does not leave tracks Good speech does not seek faults Good reckoning does not use counters Good closure needs no bar and yet cannot be opened Good knot needs no rope and yet cannot be untied Therefore sages: Often save others and so do not abandon anyone They often save things and so do not abandon anything This is called following enlightenment Therefore the good person is the teacher of the bad person The bad person is the resource of the good person Those who do not value their teachers And do not love their resources Although intelligent, they are greatly confused This is called the essential wonder 
 
第二十八章 
 
知其雄 守其雌 為天下谿 為天下谿 常德不離 復歸於嬰兒 知其白 守其黑 為天下式 為天下式 常德不忒 復歸於無極 知其榮 守其辱 為天下谷 為天下谷 常德乃足 復歸於樸 樸散則為器 聖人用之 則為官長 故大制不割 
 
Chapter 28 
 
Know the masculine, hold to the feminine Be the watercourse of the world Being the watercourse of the world The eternal virtue does not depart Return to the state of the infant Know the white, hold to the black Be the standard of the world Being the standard of the world The eternal virtue does not deviate Return to the state of the boundless Know the honor, hold to the humility Be the valley of the world Being the valley of the world The eternal virtue shall be sufficient Return to the state of plain wood Plain wood splits, then becomes tools The sages utilize them And then become leaders Thus the greater whole is undivided 
 
第二十九章 
 
將欲取天下而為之 吾見其不得已 天下神器 不可為也 為者敗之 執者失之 故物 或行或隨 或歔或吹 或強或羸 或挫或隳 是以聖人 去甚 去奢 去泰 
 
Chapter 29 
 
Those who wish to take the world and control it I see that they cannot succeed The world is a sacred instrument One cannot control it The one who controls it will fail The one who grasps it will lose Thus all things: Either lead or follow Either blow hot or cold Either have strength or weakness Either have ownership or take by force Therefore the sage: Eliminates extremes Eliminates excess Eliminates arrogance 
 
第三十章 
 
以道佐人主者 不以兵強天下 其事好還 師之所處 荊棘生焉 大軍之後 必有凶年 善有果而已 不敢以取強 果而勿矜 果而勿伐 果而勿驕 果而不得已 果而勿強 物壯則老 是謂不道 不道早已 
 
Chapter 30 
 
The one who uses the Tao to advise the ruler Does not dominate the world with soldiers Such methods tend to be returned The place where the troops camp Thistles and thorns grow Following the great army There must be an inauspicious year A good commander achieves result, then stops And does not dare to reach for domination Achieves result but does not brag Achieves result but does not flaunt Achieves result but is not arrogant Achieves result but only out of necessity Achieves result but does not dominate Things become strong and then get old This is called contrary to the Tao That which is contrary to the Tao soon ends 
 
第三十一章 
 
夫佳兵者 不祥之器 物或惡之 故有道者不處 君子居則貴左 用兵則貴右 兵者不祥之器 非君子之器 不得已而用之 恬淡為上 勝而不美 而美之者 是樂殺人 夫樂殺人者 則不可得志於天下矣 吉事尚左 凶事尚右 偏將軍居左 上將軍居右 言以喪禮處之 殺人之眾 以悲哀泣之 戰勝以喪禮處之 
 
Chapter 31 
 
A strong military, a tool of misfortune All things detest it Therefore, those who possess the Tao avoid it Honorable gentlemen, while at home, value the left When deploying the military, value the right The military is a tool of misfortune Not the tool of honorable gentlemen When using it out of necessity Calm detachment should be above all Victorious but without glory Those who glorify Are delighting in the killing Those who delight in killing Cannot achieve their ambitions upon the world Auspicious events favor the left Inauspicious events favor the right The lieutenant general is positioned to the left The major general is positioned to the right We say that they are treated as if in a funeral Those who have been killed Should be mourned with sadness Victory in war should be treated as a funeral 
 
第三十二章 
 
道常無名 樸雖小 天下莫能臣也 侯王若能守之 萬物將自賓 天地相合 以降甘露 民莫之令而自均 始制有名 名亦既有 夫亦將知止 知止可以不殆 譬道之在天下 猶川谷之於江海 
 
Chapter 32 
 
The Tao, eternally nameless Its simplicity, although imperceptible Cannot be treated by the world as subservient If the sovereign can hold on to it All will follow by themselves Heaven and Earth, together in harmony Will rain sweet dew People will not need to force it; it will adjust by itself In the beginning, there were names Names came to exist everywhere One should know when to stop Knowing when to stop, thus avoiding danger The existence of the Tao in the world Is like streams in the valley into rivers and the ocean 
 
第三十三章 
 
知人者智 自知者明 勝人者有力 自勝者強 知足者富 強行者有志 不失其所者久 死而不亡者壽 
 
Chapter 33 
 
Those who understand others are intelligent Those who understand themselves are enlightened Those who overcome others have strength Those who overcome themselves are powerful Those who know contentment are wealthy Those who proceed vigorously have willpower Those who do not lose their base endure Those who die but do not perish have longevity 
 
第三十四章 
 
大道氾兮 其可左右 萬物恃之以生而不辭 功成而不名有 衣養萬物而不為主 常無欲 可名於小 萬物歸焉而不為主 可名為大 以其終不自為大 故能成其大 
 
Chapter 34 
 
The great Tao is like a flood It can flow to the left or to the right The myriad things depend on it for life, but it never stops It achieves its work, but does not take credit It clothes and feeds myriad things, but does not rule over them Ever desiring nothing It can be named insignificant Myriad things return to it but it does not rule over them It can be named great Even in the end, it does not regard itself as great That is how it can achieve its greatness 
 
第三十五章 
 
執大象 天下往 往而不害 安平太 樂與餌 過客止 道之出口 淡乎其無味 視之不足見 聽之不足聞 用之不足既 
 
Chapter 35 
 
Hold the great image All under heaven will come They come without harm, in harmonious peace Music and food, passing travelers stop The Tao that is spoken out of the mouth Is bland and without flavor Look at it, it cannot be seen Listen to it, it cannot be heard Use it, it cannot be exhausted 
 
第三十六章 
 
將欲歙之 必固張之 將欲弱之 必固強之 將欲廢之 必固興之 將欲奪之 必固與之 是謂微明 柔弱勝剛強 魚不可脫於淵 國之利器 不可以示人 
 
Chapter 36 
 
If one wishes to shrink it One must first expand it If one wishes to weaken it One must first strengthen it If one wishes to discard it One must first promote it If one wishes to seize it One must first give it This is called subtle clarity The soft and weak overcomes the tough and strong Fish cannot leave the depths The sharp instruments of the state Cannot be shown to the people 
 
第三十七章 
 
道常無為 而無不為 侯王若能守之 萬物將自化 化而欲作 吾將鎮之以無名之樸 無名之樸 夫亦將無欲 不欲以靜 天下將自定 
 
Chapter 37 
 
The Tao is constant in non-action Yet there is nothing it does not do If the sovereign can hold on to this All things shall transform themselves Transformed, yet wishing to achieve I shall restrain them with the simplicity of the nameless The simplicity of the nameless They shall be without desire Without desire, using stillness The world shall steady itself 
 
第三十八章 
 
上德不德 是以有德 下德不失德 是以無德 上德無為 而無以為 下德為之 而有以為 上仁為之 而無以為 上義為之 而有以為 上禮為之 而莫之應 則攘臂而扔之 故失道而後德 失德而後仁 失仁而後義 失義而後禮 夫禮者 忠信之薄 而亂之首 前識者 道之華 而愚之始 是以大丈夫 處其厚 不居其薄 處其實 不居其華 故去彼取此 
 
Chapter 38 
 
High virtue is not virtuous Therefore it has virtue Low virtue never loses virtue Therefore it has no virtue High virtue takes no contrived action And acts without agenda Low virtue takes contrived action And acts with agenda High benevolence takes contrived action And acts without agenda High righteousness takes contrived action And acts with agenda High etiquette takes contrived action And upon encountering no response Uses arms to pull others Therefore, the Tao is lost, and then virtue Virtue is lost, and then benevolence Benevolence is lost, and then righteousness Righteousness is lost, and then etiquette Those who have etiquette are a thin shell of loyalty and sincerity And the beginning of chaos Those with foreknowledge Are the flowers of the Tao And the beginning of ignorance Therefore the great person: Abides in substance, and does not dwell on the thin shell Abides in the real, and does not dwell on the flower Thus they discard that and take this 
 
第三十九章 
 
昔之得一者 天得一以清 地得一以寧 神得一以靈 谷得一以盈 萬物得一以生 侯王得一以為天下貞 其致之一也 天無以清將恐裂 地無以寧將恐發 神無以靈將恐歇 谷無以盈將恐竭 萬物無以生將恐滅 侯王無以貞而貴高將恐蹶 故貴以賤為本 高以下為基 是以侯王自稱孤寡不穀 此非以賤為本耶 非乎 故致數輿無輿 不欲琭琭如玉 珞珞如石 
 
Chapter 39 
 
Those that attained oneness since ancient times: The sky attained oneness and thus clarity The earth attained oneness and thus tranquility The gods attained oneness and thus divinity The valley attained oneness and thus abundance The myriad things attained oneness and thus life The rulers attained oneness and became the world’s standard These all emerged from oneness The sky, lacking clarity, would break apart The earth, lacking tranquility, would erupt The gods, lacking divinity, would vanish The valley, lacking abundance, would wither Myriad things, lacking life, would be extinct The rulers, lacking lofty standards, would be toppled Therefore, the honored uses the lowly as basis The higher uses the lower as foundation Thus the rulers call themselves alone, bereft, and unworthy Is this not using the lowly as basis? Is it not so? Therefore, the ultimate honor is no honor Do not wish to be shiny like jade Be dull like rocks 
 
第四十章 
 
反者道之動 弱者道之用 天下萬物生於有 有生於無 
 
Chapter 40 
 
The returning is the movement of the Tao The weak is the utilization of the Tao The myriad things of the world are born of being Being is born of non-being 
 
第四十一章 
 
上士聞道 勤而行之 中士聞道 若存若亡 下士聞道 大笑之 不笑不足以為道 故建言有之 明道若昧 進道若退 夷道若纇 上德若谷 大白若辱 廣德若不足 建德若偷 質真若渝 大方無隅 大器晚成 大音希聲 大象無形 道隱無名 夫唯道 善貸且成 
 
Chapter 41 
 
Higher people hear of the Tao They diligently practice it Average people hear of the Tao They sometimes keep it and sometimes lose it Lower people hear of the Tao They laugh loudly at it If they do not laugh, it would not be the Tao Therefore a proverb has the following: The clear Tao appears unclear The advancing Tao appears to retreat The smooth Tao appears uneven High virtue appears like a valley Great integrity appears like disgrace Encompassing virtue appears insufficient Building virtue appears inactive True substance appears inconstant The great square has no corners The great vessel is late in completion The great music is imperceptible in sound The great image has no form The Tao is hidden and nameless Yet it is only the Tao That excels in giving and completing everything 
 
第四十二章 
 
道生一 一生二 二生三 三生萬物 萬物負陰而抱陽 沖氣以為和 人之所惡 唯孤寡不穀 而王公以為稱 故物 或損之而益 或益之而損 人之所教 我亦教之 強梁者不得其死 吾將以為教父 
 
Chapter 42 
 
Tao produces one One produces two Two produce three Three produce myriad things Myriad things, backed by yin and embracing yang Achieve harmony by integrating their energy What the people dislike Are alone, bereft, and unworthy But the rulers call themselves with these terms So with all things Appear to take loss but benefit Or receive benefit but lose What the ancients taught I will also teach The violent one cannot have a natural death I will use this as the principal of all teachings 
 
第四十三章 
 
天下之至柔 馳騁天下之至堅 無有 入於無間 吾是以知無為之有益 不言之教 無為之益 天下希及之 
 
Chapter 43 
 
The softest things of the world Override the hardest things of the world That which has no substance Enters into that which has no openings From this I know the benefits of unattached actions The teaching without words The benefits of actions without attachment Are rarely matched in the world

名與身孰親 身與貨孰多 得與亡孰病 是故甚愛必大費 多藏必厚亡 知足不辱 知止不殆 可以長久

以正治國 以奇用兵 以無事取天下 吾何以知其然哉 以此 天下多忌諱 而民彌貧 民多利器 國家滋昏 人多伎巧 奇物滋起 法令滋彰 盜賊多有 故聖人云 我無為而民自化 我好靜而民自正 我無事而民自富 我無欲而民自樸 
 
Chapter 57 
 
Govern a country with upright integrity Deploy the military with surprise tactics Take the world with non-interference How do I know this is so? With the following: When there are many restrictions in the world The people become more impoverished When people have many sharp weapons The country becomes more chaotic When people have many clever tricks More strange things occur The more laws are posted The more robbers and thieves there are Therefore the sage says: I take unattached action, and the people transform themselves I prefer quiet, and the people right themselves I do not interfere, and the people enrich themselves I have no desires, and the people simplify themselves

其政悶悶 其民淳淳 其政察察 其民缺缺 禍兮福之所倚 福兮禍之所伏 孰知其極 其無正耶 正復為奇 善復為妖 人之迷 其日固久 是以聖人 方而不割 廉而不劌 直而不肆 光而不耀 
 
Chapter 58

治大國若烹小鮮 以道蒞天下 其鬼不神 非其鬼不神 其神不傷人 非其神不傷人 聖人亦不傷人 夫兩不相傷 故德交歸焉 
 
Chapter 60 
 
Ruling a large country is like cooking a small fish Using the Tao to manage the world Its demons have no power Not only do its demons have no power Its gods do not harm people Not only do its gods not harm people The sages also do not harm people They both do no harm to one another So virtue merges and returns 
 
第六十一章 
 
大國者下流 天下之交 天下之牝 牝常以靜勝牡 以靜為下 故大國以下小國 則取小國 小國以下大國 則取大國 故或下以取 或下而取。 大國不過欲兼畜人 小國不過欲入事人 夫兩者各得其所欲 大者宜為下 
 
Chapter 61 
 
The large country is like the lowest river The converging point of the world The receptive female of the world The female always overcomes the male with serenity Using serenity as the lower position Thus if the large country is lower than the small country Then it can take the small country If the small country is lower than the large country Then it can be taken by the large country Thus one uses the lower position to take The other uses the lower position to be taken The large country only wishes to gather and protect people The small country only wishes to join and serve people So that both obtain what they wish The larger one should assume the lower position

道者萬物之奧 善人之寶 不善人之所保 美言可以市尊 美行可以加人 人之不善 何棄之有 故立天子 置三公 雖有拱璧以先駟馬 不如坐進此道 古之所以貴此道者何 不曰求以得 有罪以免耶 故為天下貴 
 
Chapter 62 
 
The Tao is the wonder of all things The treasure of the kind person The protection of the unkind person Admirable words can win the public's respect Admirable actions can improve people Those who are unkind How can they be abandoned? Therefore, when crowning the Emperor And installing the three ministers Although there is the offering of jade before four horses None of it can compare to being seated in this Tao Why did the ancients value this Tao so much? Is it not said that those who seek will find, And those with guilt will not be faulted? Therefore, it is the greatest value in the world 
 
第六十三章 
 
為無為 事無事 味無味 大小多少 報怨以德 圖難於其易 為大於其細 天下難事 必作於易 天下大事 必作於細 是以聖人終不為大 故能成其大 夫輕諾必寡信 多易必多難 是以聖人猶難之 故終無難矣 
 
Chapter 63 
 
Act without action Manage without meddling Taste without tasting Great, small, many, few Respond to hatred with virtue Plan difficult tasks through the simplest tasks Achieve large tasks through the smallest tasks The difficult tasks of the world Must be handled through the simple tasks The large tasks of the world Must be handled through the small tasks Therefore, sages never attempt great deeds all through life Thus they can achieve greatness One who makes promises lightly must deserve little trust One who sees many easy tasks must encounter much difficulty Therefore, sages regard things as difficult So they never encounter difficulties all through life

其安易持 其未兆易謀 其脆易破 其微易散 為之於未有 治之於未亂 合抱之木 生於毫末 九層之台 起於累土 千里之行 始於足下 為者敗之 執者失之 是以聖人 無為故無敗 無執故無失 民之從事 常於幾成而敗之 慎終如始 則無敗事 是以聖人欲不欲 不貴難得之貨 學不學 復眾人之所過 以輔萬物之自然 而不敢為

When it is peaceful, it is easy to maintain When it shows no signs, it is easy to plan   When it is fragile, it is easy to break When it is small, it is easy to scatter Act on it when it has not yet begun  Treat it when it is not yet chaotic A tree thick enough to embrace Grows from the tiny sapling A tower of nine levels Starts from the dirt heap A journey of a thousand miles Begins beneath the feet The one who meddles will fail The one who grasps will lose Therefore, sages: Do not meddle and thus do not fail Do not grasp and thus do not lose People, in handling affairs Often come close to completion and fail If they are as careful in the end as the beginning Then they would have no failure Therefore, sages desire not to desire and do not value goods that are hard to acquire They learn to unlearn and redeem the fault of the people To assist the nature of all things Without daring to meddle 
 
第六十五章 
 
古之善為道者 非以明民 將以愚之 民之難治 以其智多 故以智治國 國之賊 不以智治國 國之福 知此兩者亦稽式 常知稽式 是謂玄德 玄德 深矣 遠矣 與物反矣 然後乃至大順 
 
Chapter 65 
 
Those of ancient times who were adept at the Tao Used it not to make people brighter But to keep them simple The difficulty in governing people Is due their excessive cleverness Therefore, using cleverness to govern the state Is being a thief of the state Not using cleverness to govern the state Is being a blessing of the state Know that these two are both standards Always knowing these standards Is called Mystic Virtue Mystic Virtue: Profound! Far-reaching! It goes opposite to material things Then it reaches great congruence

江海之所以能為百谷王者 以其善下之 故能為百谷王 是以聖人欲上民 必以言下之 欲先民 必以身後之 是以聖人處上 而民不重 處前 而民不害 是以天下樂推而不厭 以其不爭 故天下莫能與之爭 
 
Chapter 66 
 
Rivers and oceans can be the kings of a hundred valleys Because of their goodness in staying low So they can be the kings of a hundred valleys Thus if sages wish to be over people They must speak humbly to them If they wish to be in front of people They must place themselves behind them Thus the sages are positioned above But the people do not feel burdened They are positioned in front But the people do not feel harmed Thus the world is glad to push them forward without resentment Because they do not contend So the world cannot contend with them 
 
第六十七章 
 
天下皆謂我道大 似不肖 夫唯大 故似不肖 若肖 久矣其細也夫 我有三寶 持而保之 一曰慈  二曰儉 三曰不敢為天下先 慈故能勇 儉故能廣 不敢為天下先 故能成器長 今捨慈且勇 捨儉且廣 捨後且先 死矣 夫慈以戰則勝 以守則固 天將救之 以慈衛之 
 
Chapter 67 
 
Everyone in the world calls my Tao great As if it is beyond compare It is only because of its greatness That it seems beyond compare If it can be compared It would already be insignificant long ago! I have three treasures I hold on to them and protect them The first is called compassion The second is called conservation The third is called not daring to be ahead in the world Compassionate, thus able to have courage Conserving, thus able to reach widely Not daring to be ahead in the world Thus able to assume leadership Now if one has courage but discards compassion Reaches widely but discards conservation Goes ahead but discards being behind Then death! If one fights with compassion, then victory With defense, then security Heaven shall save them And with compassion guard them

第六十九章 
 
用兵有言 吾不敢為主而為客 不敢進寸而退尺 是謂 行無行 攘無臂 扔無敵 執無兵 禍莫大於輕敵 輕敵幾喪吾寶 故抗兵相加 哀者勝矣 
 
Chapter 69 
 
In using the military, there is a saying: I dare not be the host, but prefer to be the guest I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to withdraw a foot This is called: Marching in formation without formation Raising arms without arms Grappling enemies without enemies Holding weapons without weapons There is no greater disaster than to underestimate the enemy Underestimating the enemy almost made me lose my treasures So when evenly matched armies meet The side that is compassionate shall win 
 
第七十章 
 
吾言甚易知 甚易行 天下莫能知 莫能行 言有宗 事有君 夫唯無知 是以不我知 知我者希 則我者貴 是以聖人被褐懷玉 
 
Chapter 70

第七十二章 
 
民不畏威 則大威至 無狎其所居 無厭其所生 夫唯不厭 是以不厭 是以聖人 自知不自見 自愛不自貴 故去彼取此

第七十三章 
 
勇於敢則殺 勇於不敢則活 此兩者或利或害 天之所惡 孰知其故 是以聖人猶難之 天之道 不爭而善勝 不言而善應 不召而自來 繟然而善謀 天網恢恢 疏而不失 
 
Chapter 73 
 
The bold in daring will be killed The bold in not daring will survive Of these two, one may benefit, the other may harm The one hated by Heaven – who knows the reason? Even the sages still find this difficult The Tao of Heaven: Does not contend and yet excels in winning Does not speak and yet excels in responding Is not summoned and yet comes on its own Is unhurried and yet excels in planning The heavenly net is vast Loose, and yet does not let anything slip through 
 
第七十四章 
 
民不畏死 奈何以死懼之 若使民常畏死 而為奇者 吾得執而殺之 孰敢 常有司殺者殺 夫代司殺者殺 是謂代大匠斲 夫代大匠斲者 希有不傷其手矣 
 
Chapter 74 
 
People do not fear death How can they be threatened with death? If people are made to constantly fear death Then those who act unlawfully I can capture and kill them Who would dare? There exists a master executioner that kills If we substitute for the master executioner to kill It is like substituting for the great carpenter to cut Those who substitute for the great carpenter to cut It is rare that they do not hurt their own hands 
 
第七十五章 
 
民之饑 以其上食稅之多 是以饑 民之難治 以其上之有為 是以難治 民之輕死 以其求生之厚 是以輕死 夫唯無以生為者 是賢於貴生 
 
Chapter 75 
 
The people's hunger Is due to the excess of their ruler's taxation So they starve The people's difficulty in being governed Is due to the meddling of their ruler So they are difficult to govern The people's disregard for death Is due to the glut in their ruler's pursuit of life So they disregard death Therefore those who do not strive for living Are better than those who value living 
 
第七十六章 
 
人之生也柔弱 其死也堅強 萬物草木 之生也柔脆 其死也枯槁 故堅強者 死之徒 柔弱者 生之徒 是以兵強則不勝 木強則共 強大處下 柔弱處上 
 
Chapter 76 
 
While alive, the body is soft and pliant When dead, it is hard and rigid All living things, grass and trees, While alive, are soft and supple When dead, become dry and brittle Thus that which is hard and stiff is the follower of death That which is soft and yielding is the follower of life Therefore, an inflexible army will not win A strong tree will be cut down The big and forceful occupy a lowly position While the soft and pliant occupy a higher place 
 
第七十七章 
 
天之道 其猶張弓乎 高者抑之 下者舉之 有餘者損之 不足者補之 天之道 損有餘 而補不足 人之道則不然 損不足 以奉有餘 孰能有餘以奉天下 唯有道者 是以聖人為而不恃 功成而不處 其不欲見賢 
 
Chapter 77 
 
The Tao of Heaven Is like drawing a bow Lower that which is high Raise that which is low Reduce that which has excess Add to that which is lacking The Tao of heaven Reduces the excessive And adds to the lacking The Tao of people is not so It reduces the lacking In order to offer to the excessive Who can offer their excess to the world? Only those who have the Tao Therefore sages act without conceit Achieve without claiming credit They do not wish to display their virtue! 
 
第七十八章 
 
天下莫柔弱於水 而攻堅強者莫之能勝 以其無以易之 弱之勝強 柔之勝剛 天下莫不知 莫能行 是以聖人云 受國之垢 是謂社稷主 受國不祥 是為天下王 正言若反 
 
Chapter 78 
 
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water Yet nothing is better at overcoming the hard and strong This is because nothing can replace it That the weak overcomes the strong And the soft overcomes the hard Everybody in the world knows But cannot put into practice Therefore sages say: The one who accepts the humiliation of the state Is called its master The one who accepts the misfortune of the state Becomes king of the world The truth seems like the opposite

True words are not beautiful Beautiful words are not true Those who are good do not debate Those who debate are not good Those who know are not broad of knowledge Those who are broad of knowledge do not know Sages do not accumulate The more they assist others, the more they possess The more they give to others, the more they gain The Tao of heaven Benefits and does not harm The Tao of sages Assists and does not contend
