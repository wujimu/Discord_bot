THE    CHINESE    PEOPLE                    35
you look at the sky, it is not big enough. With my unfettered nature, I do not like it. Only a hundred steps north from tn house, there is the Parrot Bridge, and another thirty step from the Bridge is the Plum Tower, with vacant spaces a around.  When I was drinking in this Tower in my -young days, I used to look out and see the willow banks and the m ^ wooden bridge with decrepit huts and wild flowers agai

is to build an earthen wall around it, and plant i ^ of bamboos and flowers and trees-   I am going to n garden path of paved pebbles leading from the gate to house door.  There will be two rooms, one for the par      , one for the study, where I can keep books, paintings, brusn  , ink-slabs, wine-kettle and tea service, and where 1 can a poetry and literature with some good friends and the young generation.   Behind this will be the family l™ngf oo^> with three main rooms, two kitchens and one servants roo   -Altogether there will be eight rooms, all ™^™***L sheds, and I shall be quit! content.  Early m the mornmg before sunrise, I could look east and see the red glow _oi morning clouds, and at sunset, the sun will shine from J*n the trees. When one stands upon a high place in the ^co yard, one can already see the bridge and the cloudsan waters in the distance, and when giving a party at n .3   > one can see the lights of the neighbours outside the ; w   _. This will be only thirty steps to your house on the ^'    u will be separated from the little garden on the east Dy creek.  So it is quite ideal.  Some may say     I his B        ^ very comfortable, only there may be burglars.     A J not know that burglars are also but poor people,   i open the door and invite them to come m, and discuss them what they may share. Whatever there is, .they. can away, and if nothing will really suit them, they may e take away the great Wang Hsienchih's old capret to pa*n for a hundred cash. Please, my younger
