IDEALS    OF    LIFE                        115
The Chinese ideal of happiness was, then, not the "exercise of one's powers along the lines of their excellence/' as was that of the Greeks, but the enjoyment of this simple rural life, together with the harmony of social relationships.
The real force of Taoism, especially among the people, however, consists largely in supplying a world of unknowables, which Confucian good sense banished from its province of ideas.

One of the famous poets compared the Confucian gentleman walking in his narrow path of righteousness to a bug creeping along the seams of a man's trousers. Man's nature had rebelled against Confucian
