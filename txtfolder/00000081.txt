In the home the woman rules. No modern man can still believe with Shakespeare that "Frailty, thy name is woman!" Shakespeare disproved this himself with his Cleopatra, and with King Lear's daughters.

She ruled with a wise and benign rulership, and all the daughters-in-law were her willing slaves. The character is
