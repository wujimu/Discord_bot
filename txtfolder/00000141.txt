LITERARY    LIFE                          259
sole heir of all great families in China, doted on by his grandmother, the highest authority of the household, but extremely afraid of his father, completely admired by all his female cousins and catered for by his maid-servants, who attended to his bath and sat in watch over him at night; his love for Taiyti, hi$ orphan cousin staying in their house, who was suffering from consumption and was fed on birds'-nest soup, easily outshining the rest in beauty and poetry, but a little too clever to be happy like the more stupid ones, opening her love to Paoyii with the purity and intensity of a young maiden's heart; another female cousin, Pacts'a, also in love with Paoyu, but plumper and more practical-minded and considered a better wife by the elders; the final deception, arrangements for the wedding to Paots'a by the mothers without Paoyti's or Taiytf s knowledge, Taiyii not hearing of it until shortly before the wedding, which made her laugh hysterically and sent her to her death, and Paoyii not hearing of it till the wedding night; Paoyu's discovery of the deception by his own parents, Ms becoming half-idiotic and losing his mind, and finally his becoming a monk.
