WOMAN'S  LIFE                      14.1

Besides, women have always the weapon of sex, which they can use to great advantage. It is nature's guarantee for their equality. Somehow every man3 from emperor to butcher, baker and candlestick-maker, has scolded his wife and been scolded by her, because nature has ordained that man and woman should meet in their intimacies as equals.

For it must be remembered that a marriage in China is not an individual affair but a family affair; a man does not marry a wife but "marries a daughter-in-law/* as the idiomatic expression goes, and when a son is born, the idiomatic expression is "a grandson has been bam/* A
