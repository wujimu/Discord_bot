Picturesque scenery is then used to suggest certain thoughts very much in the same way as certain chords in the Wagnerian operas are used to suggest the entrance of certain characters. Logically, there is little connection between the scenery and the man's inner thoughts, but symbolically and emotionally, there is a connection. The method, called ksing, or evocation, is as ancient as the Book of Poetry. In Tsang poetry, for instance, the passing of a fallen dynasty is variously expressed by such symbolic method, without mentioning the thoughts themselves. Thus Wei Ghuang sang of the past glories of Nanking in the following manner in his poem On a Painting of Chinling;
