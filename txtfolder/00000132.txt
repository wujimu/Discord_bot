which comes from loves as sharp as a lover's eyes, and as unfailing and correct as a mother's intuition. This Einfuklung^ this sharing of human emotions with the universe, this poetic transformation of dead objects which makes the moss "mount" one's doorstep and the colour of grass ''enter" one's window-screen, this poetic illusion,, for illusion it is, is felt so intuitively and so constantly that it seems to constitute the very essence of Chinese poetry.

No strict classification is, of course, possible, but there was a third group of sentimental poets, like Li Ho (Li Ch'angchi, 790-816), Li Shangyto (813-858) and his contemporary Wen T'ingyii%
