STORY   OF   THE   SINO-JAFANESE   WAR        363

It was a remarkable testimony to the Chinese Government's popular strength that although it was taking a more moderate and less anti-Japanese position, it came out of every rebellion stronger than before. Chiang Kaishek settled the rebellions with firmness and considerable sagacity. Some of his immature rawness had worn off, and he showed more temperance. In his dealing with the Kwangsi Rebellion, he rose to the full stature of a
