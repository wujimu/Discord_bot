Huang or Major Li is inhuman and therefore no law at all. Chinese justice is an art, not a science.
Jespersen, in his well-known book, The Growth and Structure of English, once referred to the masculine qualities of the English language by pointing to its love of economy, common sense and forcefulness. Without wishing to contradict so great an authority on the English language, I beg to differ on a point which concerns the sexes. Common sense and the practical mind are characteristics of women rather than of men, who are more liable to take their feet off the ground and soar to impossible heights. The Chinese language and grammar show this femininity exactly because the language, in its form, syntax and vocabulary, reveals an extreme simplicity of thinking, concreteness of imagery and economy of syntactical relationships.
This simplicity is best illustrated from pidgin, which is English meat with Chinese bones, as we say in China. There is no reason why a sentence like "He come, you no come; you come, he no come" should not be considered as clear as the more roundabout "You needn't come, if he comes, and he needn't come, if you come." In fact, this simplicity makes for clarity of expression. Moon, in Deatfs English, quotes an English Somerset farmer as testifying before the judge: "He'd a stick, and he'd a stick, and he licked he, and he licked he; if he licked he as hard as he licked he, he'd a killed he, and not he he," and this seems to me a much more sensible way of talking than one with the Germanic case-distinctions. For according to the Chinese, the difference between "I lick he" and "he lick P is perfectly clear without the subjective-accusative complex, and the adding of the third person singular ending "s" is as superfluous as is already proved to be in the past tense (I had, he had; I went, he went). Actually lots of people are saying "us girls" and "them things" without ever being misunderstood or losing anything except a meaningless "class" which has nothing to do with the beauty of expression.-1 have great hope that English and American professors will one day bravely and respectably pronounce a "he don't" in the classrooms and that the English language may one day become as sensible and clear as the Chinese, through the influence of pidgin.
