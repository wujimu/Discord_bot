the Renaissance of 1917 became out of date overnight, and were generously labelled as "old men." Young China was disgusted and rebelled. Most intellectual leaders had learned to keep quiet and started collecting curios and old seals. Hu Shih continued to thunder and to roar, but his words fell on a comparatively apathetic audience, which wanted something very much more radical. Chou Tsojen, Yu Tafu and writers of the Yussii school were too much individualists to join the throng. Lusin fought, resisted the tide for a year and then went over.
In the short space of hardly two years (1928-9), over a hundred Russian literary works, long and short, were put on the market with hectic speed, before the Government could quite wake up to the situation. These include works by the following authors: Lunacharsky, Liebediensky, Michels, Fadeevs Glad-hov, Kollontay, Shishkov, Romanov, Pilniak, Ognyov, Sos-novsky, Shaginian, Yakovlev, Alexei Tolstoy, Demidov, Erenburg, Arosev, Babel, Kasatkin, Ivanov, Iva, Luuts, Sannikoff, Seyfullina, Bakhmetev, Fedin? Serafimovitchs Prish-vin, Semenov, Sholokhov, NVNV, Vessely, Zoschenko, Tretiakev, Sobole, Kolosov., Formanov, and Figner, We have omitted to mention, of course, the "great Russians39 of pre-revolutionary days, like Pushkin, Tchekov, Tolstoy and Turgeniev, who had before this time been familiar to the reading public. Tchekov's complete works have been translated; Tolstoy is known through twenty of his works, including the long War and Peace (translated in part only), Anna Karenina and The Resurrection; Dostoievsky is a great favourite (seven of his works, including Crime and Punishment); Turgeniev had long been known (twenty-one of his works translated). Gorky, bridging across the two peiiods, is, of course, popular. Eroshenko, Andreyev and Artzybashev are also popular, due to Lusin's influence. As a sign of the feverish demand for things Russian may be-mentioned the curious fact that twenty-three out of the barely over hundred post-revolutionary works had double translations published by rival companies at about the same time, including four which appeared in three simultaneous translations. Among the more popular works may be mentioned Madame Kollontay"s Red Love (two translations),
