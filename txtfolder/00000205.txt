STORY   OF   THE   SINO-JAPANESE   WAR       387
upon Japan by itself. Rather, the' Pacific Powers will now raise their voices a little louder, and Japanese diplomats will lower their voices a little softer, and now that the American public is at last assured of no war with a weakened Japan and liberated from its ridiculous fear of a Japan seeking war with the United States during her occupation with China and Russia, the American Government, treading still in the mincing steps of merely "parallel action" with the Pacific Powers free from all entanglements, will be able to go ahead and enforce peace in the Orient. Although British-American joint action, backed by force, will be able to demand indemnities for China, American aloofness will not support the use of force for this purpose. Rather, the Pacific Powers will be interested, in the first place, in re-stating the Open Door Policy and the principles of the Washington Treaty, and in the second place in limiting Japan's military and naval strength. What a golden chance for eliminating a Pacific rival! I am not implying any lack of American friendship or sympathy for China, but base my comment on the hard fact that all talk of "international friendship35 in all countries is merely a diplomatic mode of speech and sheer rubbish, and that all international diplomacy is based not on sentiment, but on the conflict or community of interests.
From an enlightened diplomatic outlook, however, both China and the other Pacific Powers should, in order to repair a serious and fatal gap in the Japanese political constitution which may at any moment engulf both the Japanese people and their neighbours in war again, demand firmly, in the interests of peace for the Japanese people and others, the constitutional curtailment of the power of the Japanese army and navy, the elimination of their super-cabinet, super-parliament and super-legal privileges, and the restoration of true democracy for Japan. There is a great chance that, at the conclusion of the disastrous war, such a demand will fall in line with the sentiments already existing in Japanese parliamentarians and will hasten the overthrow of the Japanese Fascists. The Japanese people must be protected against their own bloodthirsty, war-mad and glory-drunk militarists, and the hand of democratic forces must be strengthened in Japan.
