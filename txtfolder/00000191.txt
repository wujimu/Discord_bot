STORY   OF   THE   SINO-JAPANESE   WAR       359
Under the heading of Japanese expansion may be mentioned the following: The conquest of Manchuria in 1931-32, the seizure of Jehol in 1933; the conclusion of the Tangku Pact giving Japan a demilitarized zone in the same year; the Eji Amau declaration of Asia for the Asiatics in 1933; the silent penetration into Chahar in 1934-5; the setting up of the East Hopei regime in the demilitarized zone designated by the Japanese in 1935 and its expansion toward Peiping; the immediate use of this bogus regime as base for huge-scale smuggling and spread of the narcotic trade with its centre in the Japanese Concession at Tientsin; the full-fledged smuggling reaching tens of millions of dollars in open defiance of Chinese customs in Chinese territory in 1935-6; the open declaration in 1935-6 by various Japanese generals in North China that Chiang Kaishek must be overthrown and that a "surgical operation'5 must be "performed on North China'*; the enunciation in 1935 of Hirota's "Three Principles" (China-Japan-Manchukuo co-operation, China's abandonment of co-operation with the Western Powers, and abandonment of anti-Japanese policy); the virtual Japanese domination of the semi-autonomous Hopei-Chahar Council under Sung Cheh-yuan, set up by Chiang Kaishek as a temporary buffer-instrument; the attempt at the conquest of Suiyuan in 1936, a few months before the Sian incident; finally the openly and repeatedly announced Japanese intrigue led by Doihara, to make the "five northern provinces'5 (Chahar, Suiyuan, Hopei, Shantung and Shansi) a second Manchukuo as their immediate, unchangeable objective; and then the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937.
