In China such cases are happening every day before our eyes, and it has sometimes seemed to me that the modem woman who drives out the old wife with her feminine ferocity approximates very nearly the state of barbarism of our forefathers, in spite of the fact that she is modem enough not to tolerate living under the same roof with another woman as her equal.

The best reply to this are the words of Fan Chinlien, concubine of Hsinrch Ch'ing in Chinp'inmei: "Do you ever see two spcpa^fn the same bowl that do not knock against each other?** She knew what she was talking about . ^^^
